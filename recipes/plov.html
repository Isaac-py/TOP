    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe describes a traditional Uzbek plov made with aromatic devzira rice, beef, and spices. The cooking process begins with frying the meat until golden brown, followed by adding onions and carrots to create the base of the dish—zirvak. Once the spices, including cumin, garlic, and hot red pepper, are added, the mixture is simmered for about 40 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>
    <p>After that, the thoroughly washed and soaked rice is carefully layered over the zirvak, covered with water, and cooked until all the liquid is absorbed. The plov is then left to steam under a lid, ensuring a fluffy texture and rich aroma. Before serving, it is garnished with fresh green onions, chili peppers, and pomegranate seeds, with quail eggs added for a finishing touch. This dish offers a perfect balance of flavors, spices, and an elegant presentation.</p>
